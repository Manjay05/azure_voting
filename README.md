the idea is to store the vote of candidate on azure.
we can do this by using aadhar card as identification of voters.
we can develop a software where aadhar card address is used to identify the constituency of voters and voter need not have to go to specified polling booth to caste his/her vote. He/She can go on any voting day and any polling booth to caste the vote.
voter just have to go to polling booth and login with reina scan/ thumb impression and his/her constituency's cnadidate list will come on screenn and he/she just has to click/touch on the candidate's name/ photo his/her election symbol.
